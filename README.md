# AControl
**AC**ontrol is an AC remote control interface made for our Human-Computer Interaction course @AUEB. 

The app's functions are based on those of any existing AC device. Our goal was to simplify and improve user experience as well as provide accessibility options that were previously non-existent. The final application offers voice command control, haptic and audio feedback. During the implementation we followed the Spiral development method, a full report including the stages of each cycle and the evaluation methods used can be found [here](./report.pdf). 

# Available Screens & Functions
The app contains 3 activity screens:
- Main Screen
- Advanced Features Screen
- Timer Screen

## Main Screen
The main screen is the launcher screen of the application since it contains the most important interface options. Voice control can also be used in the main screen's featured functions. Each of these functions offers a variety of visual, audio or haptic feedback to make sure the user is aware of the device's state at all times.

### ON/OFF
The interface has a power button meant for powering the AC on and off.

The target temperature can be set through the temperature control menu.
