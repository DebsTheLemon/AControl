# AControl
AControl is an AC remote control interface made for our Human-Computer Interaction course @AUEB. 
The app's functions are based on those of an existing AC device. Our goal was to simplify and improve user experience as well as 
providing more accessibility options such as voice commands, haptic & audio feedback. During the implementation we followed the 
Spiral development method, a full report including the stages of each cycle and the evaluation methods used can be found [here](./report.pdf).
