# AControl
AControl is an AC remote control interface made for our Human-Computer Interaction course @AUEB. 
The app's functions are based on those of an existing AC device. Our goal was to simplify and improve user experience as well as 
provide accessibility options. The final application offers voice command control and haptic & audio feedback. During the implementation we followed the Spiral development method, a full report including the stages of each cycle and the evaluation methods used can be found [here](./report.pdf).
